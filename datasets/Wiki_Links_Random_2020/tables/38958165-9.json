                "text": "The episode begins where the last one left off, with Washington and North Dakota heading to a training match featuring a new Freelancer. In the match, the new Freelancer, Agent Texas, spars with Wyoming, Maine, and York. Meanwhile Freelancers Washington, North Dakota, South Dakota, Carolina, and C.T., overlook the battle from above. During the match, using her strength and agility, Tex easily defeats her three opponents, winning Round one. As Round two begins, York tries to coordinate a plan with his teammates. However, Maine and Wyoming, attack by themselves instead, leading to all three having many repeated failures. The three then start attacking Tex from all sides. Tex, however, easily kicks and punches them around, impressing the other Freelancers overlooking the battle. York tries again to regroup his team, but continues to be ignored by Maine and Wyoming, leading to further defeat. In round three, the arena is reconfigured to feature raised cover, and the four Freelancers are given guns to use, which fire a special immobilizing paint that makes their armor stone hard. While York, Maine, and Wyoming look for Tex in the arena, Tex quietly uses her surroundings to get the best of them. Tex continually outsmarts her opponents, eventually winning rounds three to eight. In round nine, Maine and Wyoming purposely load their pistols with live ammunition, shocking York. As the two start firing, York tries to protect Tex, but she refuses his help, telling him \"Never abandon your team.\" As the battle becomes more intense Maine throws a grenade towards Tex, which she easily dodges. Unfortunately, the grenade lands near York, but before it explodes, Tex shoots him with the immobilizing paint, to try to protect him. The grenade explodes as the episode ends, alarms are heard, and a medical team is sent to the training room.",
